    The scroll‑container gives the page height.  It is set in the CSS to be
    much taller than the viewport so that the user can scroll down slowly.
    We keep the shapes and text fixed on the screen (using CSS
    position: fixed) so they appear to float while the background and
    animation change with the scroll.

         with the page.  Each element uses CSS to define its base size,
         colour and circular shape.  JavaScript scales them up and down
         according to the scroll progress. -->
